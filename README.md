functional-js-graphics: behold, the Javascript JIT
======
Pixel shaders in Javascript. Should be incredibly slow, but the JIT is amazing.

This demo renders a four-quadrant image, and then rotates it.  Watch the precision decay, and keep watching, because at 2:45 something really untoward happens.  I guess this is low-res digital feedback.

I've spent more time watching this thing than I did writing it, which is the definition of success for a graphics hack.
